### 3Obiektywy
Hello World! I'd like to present a small amateur photo portfolio created for me and my 2 friends. I write this project for practice of html, scss and vanilla JavaScript. 

### Tools and technologies

* HTML5  (semantic code and BEM)
* CSS3 (flex + SCSS/SASS)
* JavaScript ES6
* Node.js + NPM
* Gulp
* Visual Studio Code
* Figma 
* Instagramfeed library (used in dist catalog which is used to deploy project on the server and isn't uploaded to github) [InstagramFeed for Vanilla JS](https://www.cssscript.com/instagram-photos-feed/)

You can see this website [here](https://karolchilimoniuk.github.io/3Obiektywy/index.html) or if you want, you can clone my repo, and next use command :

```
npm install 
```
to install npms necessary to work with project.

To work comfortably on local server use command:

```
gulp
```
